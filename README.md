## Features
- Drag-and-drop interface for elements.
- CRUD operations on elements.
- Nesting elements inside each other.
- Element selection and padding adjustments.
- Login page with form validation and error handling.
- Redux for state management.
- Local storage for persistence.
- Bonus: Element resizing, background color, and margin controls.

## Data Storage

This project uses Redux Toolkit for state management and local storage (via Redux Persist) for data persistence across page reloads.

### Redux State Management

build.ts: Stores the drag-and-drop elements for each user, handling creation, updates, and deletions.

selected.ts: Tracks the currently selected user and element, ensuring UI interactions update correctly.

users.ts: Manages user registration and authentication details.


### Local Storage Persistence

he Redux store is persisted using redux-persist, so data (elements, users, selections) remains saved even after a page refresh.

The persistConfig in index.ts ensures that all state is stored in the browser’s local storage.



This setup allows the app to maintain various user sessions and keep the page builder’s state intact across visits.
